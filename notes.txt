Notes: 

Call on these files through their local URL

“/files/FILENAME.ext”. 

For example, if you wanted to access a picture saved as
Image1.jpg, make sure it is saved in the files folder and referred to with the URL 

/files/Image1.jpg. 

Start all filepaths beginning with “/files/”; otherwise, they will NOT WORK when they are evaluated. 
Feel free to add sub folders within this file to improve organization (i.e., an “images” subfolder). 
For example, place the following inside the “files” folder:


Any images, logos or symbology used for your application
Any additional authoritative datasets
